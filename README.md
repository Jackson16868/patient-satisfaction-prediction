# Patient Satisfaction Prediction — Hospital Management Dataset

This repository contains data analysis and machine learning experiments to
predict **patient satisfaction** based on hospital operational metrics.

The goal of this project is to:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build ML models to predict `patient_satisfaction`
- Compare Linear Regression baseline vs. Random Forest
- Identify key features that drive satisfaction (KPI analysis)
